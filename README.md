# Neuron Lab - DATA ANALYSIS Intern (September 2023 - October 2023)

During my internship, I actively engaged in the world of data, encompassing tasks such as data exploration,  data cleaning, , data visualization, data manipulation and in-depth analysis to uncover valuable insights and discern meaningful relationships within the data.

I used R and Excel to analyze complex datasets, including a 12-month sales dataset, a 32,942-customer call center dataset, a 6-year World War II aerial bombing dataset, and COVID-19 data from 170 countries. I handled outliers, cleaned and prepared data for analysis, and uncovered valuable insights by scrutinizing data relationships. I created an Excel dashboard with diverse charts to highlight key metrics from the call center dataset. Additionally, I used R to showcase the impact of weather on operational outcomes in the World War II dataset and analyzed global trends in COVID-19 data, identifying the most affected regions and exploring the comprehensive impact on social indicators and economies.
